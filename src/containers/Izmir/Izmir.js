                    İzmir, often spelled Izmir in English (from greek: Σμύρνη, romanizided: Smýrni or Smýrnē / in english: Smyrna) is a metropolitan city in the western extremity of Anatolia. It is the third most populous city in Turkey, after Istanbul and Ankara, and the second largest metropolitan area on the Aegean Sea after Athens, Greece. In 2018, the city of İzmir had a population of 2,947,000, while İzmir Province had a total population of 4,320,519.[1][2] İzmir's metropolitan area extends along the outlying waters of the Gulf of İzmir and inland to the north across the Gediz River delta; to the east along an alluvial plain created by several small streams; and to slightly more rugged terrain in the south.

                    In classical antiquity the city was known as Smyrna (/ˈsmɜːrnə/ SMUR-nə), a name which remained in use in English and other Western foreign languages until circa 1930.[5] However, the historic name Smyrna is still used today in some languages, such as Greek (Σμύρνη, Smýrnē), Armenian (Զմյուռնիա, Zmyurnia), Italian (Smirne), and Spanish (Esmirna). Smyrna have more than 3,000 years of recorded urban history, and up to 8,500 years of history as a human settlement since the Neolithic period. Lying on an advantageous location at the head of a gulf running down in a deep indentation, midway along the western Anatolian coast, it has been one of the principal mercantile cities of the Mediterranean Sea for much of its history.
